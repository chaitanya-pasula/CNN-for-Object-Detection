# CNN-for-Object-Detection
Worked on a Convolutional Neural Network that leverages the characteristics of various background substraction algorithms to produce state-of-the-art foreground object detection
Explored and implemented various Python Libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn etc
Researched and Implemented various Machine learning concepts like Supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning etc
